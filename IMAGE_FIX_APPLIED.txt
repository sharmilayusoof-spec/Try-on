IMAGE NOT DISPLAYING - FIX APPLIED
=====================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- Images exist but not displaying
- Console shows: "[Intervention] Images loaded lazily and replaced with placeholders"
- Root cause: loading="lazy" attribute causing Chrome to defer image loading

FIX APPLIED:
1. Changed loading="lazy" to loading="eager" in frontend/script.js
2. Added onload/onerror handlers for better debugging
3. Added console logging for image load status

FILES MODIFIED:
- frontend/script.js (line ~354) - Changed lazy to eager loading

FILES CREATED:
- IMAGE_NOT_DISPLAYING_FIX.md - Complete debugging guide
- frontend/test_images.html - Image loading test page

TESTING:
1. Open frontend/index.html in browser
2. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
3. Check console for "✓ Image loaded" messages
4. Images should now be visible

VERIFICATION TEST:
Open frontend/test_images.html to test all loading methods

EXPECTED RESULT:
- All 6 clothing images visible immediately
- Console shows: "✓ Image loaded: [name] (512x512)"
- No blank spaces in clothing grid

IF STILL NOT WORKING:
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Check DevTools Network tab for 404 errors
3. Verify images exist: ls frontend/assets/clothes/
4. Run: python verify_images.py
5. See IMAGE_NOT_DISPLAYING_FIX.md for detailed debugging

QUICK CHECKLIST:
☐ Images exist in frontend/assets/clothes/
☐ Browser cache cleared (Ctrl+Shift+R)
☐ Console shows image load messages
☐ No 404 errors in Network tab
☐ Images visible in UI
